<p>A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. 
Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, grape juice, 
jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil.</p>

<p>Today, 72 million tons of grapes are grown each year worldwide, mostly to produce wine. 
Every year, 7.2 trillion gallons of wine are produced. Grapes are also a popular finger food.</p>
